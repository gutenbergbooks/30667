<h2>THE TALE OF OLD DOG SPOT</h2>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I <br />ALMOST TWINS</h2>

<p>Nobody ever spoke of old Spot's master
as "old Johnnie Green." Yet the two&mdash;boy
and dog&mdash;were almost exactly the
same age. Somehow Spot grew up faster
than Johnnie. He had stopped being a
puppy by the time his young master
learned to walk. And when Johnnie was
big enough to play around the farm buildings
his parents felt sure that he was safe
so long as "old Spot," as they called the
dog, was with him.</p>

<p>Spot thought himself years older than
the small boy; or at least he always acted
so. If a goose hissed at little, toddling
Johnnie Green, old Spot would drive the
goose away, barking in a loud voice,
"Don't you frighten this child!" If
Johnnie went into the stable and wandered
within reach of the horses' heels
Spot would take hold of his clothes and
draw him gently back out of danger.
And if Johnnie strayed to the duck pond
the old dog wouldn't leave him even to
chase the cat, but stayed right there by
the pond, ready to pull his young charge
out of the water in case he happened to
fall in.</p>

<p>Spot seemed to enjoy his task of taking
care of Johnnie Green. It wasn't all
work. A great deal of pleasure went with
his duties, for Johnnie Green never
wanted to do anything but play. And
Spot wasn't so grown up that he couldn't
enjoy a lively romp. For that matter, he
never did get over his liking for boisterous
fun.</p>

<p>Still, there were some kinds of sport
that he didn't care for. He wasn't fond
of having such things as tin cans tied to
his tail. He disliked to be harnessed to a
toy wagon. He hated to have his ears
pulled. Yet there was only one offense
that ever made him growl. When Johnnie
Green took a bone away from him Spot
couldn't help warning him, with a deep,
rumbling grumbling, that he was going
too far, even between friends. But he
never snapped at Johnnie. That growling
was only Spot's way of teaching
Johnnie Green manners.</p>

<p>Fond as he was of his young master,
Spot did not care to spend all his time
playing childish games. There were
grown-up things that he liked to do&mdash;things
in which a toddler like Johnnie
Green couldn't take part. Around the
farmhouse there were always the cat to be
teased and squirrels to be chased into
trees. In the pasture there were woodchucks
to be hunted; and even if he
couldn't catch them it was fun to see
those fat fellows tumble into their
holes.</p>

<p>Then there were the cows. Spot loved
to help Farmer Green drive them home
late in the afternoon. He acted very important
when he went for the cows, always
pretending that it was hard work, though
he really thought it great sport.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Johnnie Green wanted
to play with Spot the old dog couldn't be
found anywhere. He might be over the
hill, visiting a neighbor's dog. He might
be in the woods, looking for birds. He
might even have followed a wagon to the
village.</p>

<p>As Johnnie Green grew older he roamed
through the woods with Spot. And when
Johnnie's father at last let him own a
gun, old Spot was as pleased as Johnnie
was.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting for this event for
several years," Spot told the Muley Cow.</p>

<p>She did not share his delight.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, keep that boy and his
gun out of the pasture!" she bellowed.
"It frightens me to have him come near
me with his blunderbuss."</p>

<p>Old Spot gave her a pitying look.</p>

<p>"It's plain," he said, "that you don't
come from a sporting family, as I do, or
you'd never speak in that fashion of a
nice new shotgun. You know I'm a
sporting dog. I'm a pointer. I point out
the game for the hunters."</p>

<p>The Muley Cow gave a sort of snort
and tossed her head.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for Johnnie Green," she
sniffed, "that I'm not a sporting cow, or
he might not have any butter on his
bread."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II <br />TEASING THE CAT </h2>


<p>When Miss Kitty Cat came to the farmhouse
to live she soon showed old dog
Spot that she could fight like a vixen.
The first time he cornered her she put
some scratches on his nose that he never
forgot. And after that he always took
great pains to keep out of reach of Miss
Kitty's claws.</p>

<p>So long as Miss Kitty Cat ran away
from him Spot would follow her, yelping
madly. But when she stopped, he
stopped too, digging his own claws into
the dirt in order to leave a safe distance
between Miss Kitty and his nose.</p>

<p><a name="illus1">He quickly discovered that there were
ways in which he could tease Miss Kitty
Cat that annoyed her greatly, while keeping
his nose out of harm's way.</a> Growling
always made her tail grow big.
Barking made her spit at him. But there
was something else that angered her still
more. When Spot stood stock still one
day, with his tail stuck straight out behind
him, and pointed at her with his nose,
he made her almost frantic.</p>

<p>"What are you pointing at with that
long nose of yours?" Miss Kitty Cat
snarled.</p>

<p>Spot didn't say a word. For the moment
he didn't move any more than the
iron dog did, that stood in a yard on the
outskirts of the village and never so much
as wagged his tail from one year's end to
another.</p>

<p>Somehow Spot's queer behavior gave
Miss Kitty Cat an odd, creepy feeling
along her back. Her fur rose on end.
She glared at Spot and spat at him in a
most unladylike fashion.</p>

<p>Spot found it very hard to stand still
and never let out a single yelp. Once he
almost whined. But he managed to stifle
the sound.</p>

<p>"If she swells up much more she's
likely to burst," he thought.</p>

<p>"Go away!" Miss Kitty scolded.
"Don't you know better than to stare at
a lady?"</p>

<p>Never an answer did old Spot make.</p>

<p>It was a little more than Miss Kitty
Cat could endure. With a yowl that had
in it something of anger and something
of fear, too, she jumped off the doorstep
where she had been sitting and whisked
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>With Miss Kitty's first leap Spot came
suddenly to life. He barked joyfully and
followed her. Miss Kitty Cat ran up a
tree in the yard and stayed there until
Spot went off chuckling.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I played that trick on her,"
he said to himself. "It seems to bother
her more than anything else I've ever
tried."</p>

<p>Thereafter Spot often pointed at Miss
Kitty when he met her, either inside the
house or about the yard. And she never
failed to fly into a passion.</p>

<p>"Such manners I never saw!" she
spluttered when she talked one day with a
cat from the nearest farmhouse.</p>

<p>"I'd soon cure the old dog of that unpleasant
trick if he tried it on me," her
neighbor remarked.</p>

<p>"What would you do?" Miss Kitty Cat
wanted to know.</p>

<p>"I'd chase him."</p>

<p>"He can run faster than I can," said
Miss Kitty.</p>

<p>"When he's pointing at you, jump at
him before he can turn around. If you
drag your claws across his nose just once
he'll be careful after that to look the
other way when he sees you."</p>

<p>"Your plan sounds as if it might be
worth trying," said Miss Kitty thoughtfully.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />A WILD DOG</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot felt greatly pleased with
himself. He had told everybody that
would listen to him how he could make
Miss Kitty Cat angry just by standing
still and pointing at her.</p>

<p>"You'd better leave that cat alone," the
old horse Ebenezer advised him. "Don't
you remember how she clawed you when
you cornered her in this barn one day?"</p>

<p>"I remember&mdash;yes!" Spot admitted, as
he looked cross-eyed at his nose, which
still bore the marks of Miss Kitty's claws.
"I'm careful not to stand too near her,"
he explained. "I don't try to grab her.
I just stare at her. And she gets wild."</p>

<p>"A wild cat," old Ebenezer warned
him, "is a dangerous creature."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Spot. "She always
sneaks away after I've pointed at her for
a few minutes. It's the funniest sight!
If you could see it once you'd know she
was terribly afraid of me."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said the old horse Ebenezer.
But he couldn't make Spot believe
there was the slightest danger in teasing
Miss Kitty Cat.</p>

<p>"She always runs up a tree after I've
been pointing at her," Spot went on.</p>

<p>"You'd better look out!" Ebenezer cautioned
him. "She'll have you climbing a
tree the first thing you know."</p>

<p>Well, that made Spot laugh. And he
went out of the barn feeling even more
pleased with himself than ever. He was
sorry that Miss Kitty Cat wasn't in the
yard. He felt just like bothering her.</p>

<p>"I'll go up to the pasture and find me
a woodchuck to chase," Spot said to himself,
for he was in such high spirits that
he simply had to have fun of some sort.</p>

<p>First, however, he decided to stop and
dig up a bone that he had buried in the
flower garden. So he trotted across the
yard. And as he drew near the farmhouse
he changed his plans all at once.
He forgot his bone and he forgot his
woodchuck, too. For he caught sight of
something that had escaped his eye before.
Stretched on the ledge outside one of the
kitchen windows Miss Kitty Cat was enjoying
a nap in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Spot very softly. "Aha!
Here's a bit of luck." And he turned
sharply aside and hurried towards the
house, to come to a dead stop beneath the
window and stand there motionless with
his nose pointing at the sleeping form of
Miss Kitty.</p>

<p>Though Spot didn't make the slightest
noise the sleeper suddenly opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Tchah!</i>" she exclaimed, springing to
her feet and glaring at her annoyer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 429px;">
<a name="Barn" id="Barn"></a>
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="429" height="600" alt="Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door." title="Barn" />
<span class="caption">Spot Bolted Through the Barn Door.
<br />
<a href="#illus2">(<i>Page 16</i>)</a></span>
</div>

<p>If the window hadn't been closed no
doubt Miss Kitty would have slipped
through it into the kitchen. But there
was no escape that way.</p>

<p>"It's a pity," she muttered, "that a
person can't take a cat nap without being
stared at by this old dog. I think it's
about time I took my neighbor's advice
and taught him to keep his eyes and his
nose where they belong."</p>

<p>Then Miss Kitty Cat jumped. She
jumped off the window ledge straight at
old dog Spot, who was still gazing up at
her from below.</p>

<p>When he saw her coming he gave a
startled yelp and tried to dodge her. But
he was too slow. Miss Kitty Cat landed
squarely on his back and clawed him savagely.</p>

<p>Old Spot dashed half way across the
farmyard, then dropped suddenly and
rolled over and over on the ground.</p>

<p>The next instant he was on his feet
again and tearing toward the barn.
Though Miss Kitty had dropped off his
back and was already on her way to the
house he did not look around to see what
had become of her.</p>

<p><a name="illus2">Spot bolted through the barn door</a> and
scurried into an empty stall, where he
jumped into the manger and cowered
down in the hay that half filled it, and
moaned.</p>

<p>It was the stall next to the old horse
Ebenezer's. And that mild fellow peered
over at him in wonder. "What has happened?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"The cat scratched me," Spot told him.
"I was teasing her and she wasn't at all
nice about it."</p>

<p>"What were you doing&mdash;pointing at
her?" Ebenezer asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"I suppose it made her wild," the old
horse remarked. "And a wild cat is a
dangerous creature."</p>

<p>Spot whined fretfully. He wished he
could lick his wounds. But how can one
lick scratches when they are behind one's
ears?</p>

<p>"I was a wild dog for a few moments,"
he groaned. "I never dreamed she would
plump down on me like that."</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever heard of it's raining
cats and dogs?" Ebenezer said. "Well,
to-day it rained cats."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<br />THE WOODPILE</h2>

<p>Farmer Green always had a woodpile in
the back yard. Sometimes it was big.
Sometimes it was little. Sometimes it
was mostly made up of four-foot logs.
Sometimes the logs were all split and
sawed, ready to burn.</p>

<p>When Farmer Green and the hired
man had nothing more pressing to do they
set to work on the woodpile. It was surprising
how fast the big sticks grew into
firewood under their axes and saws.</p>

<p>One day they started sawing and splitting
when Johnnie Green and old dog
Spot were roaming through the woods.
And when Johnnie and Spot came back
home, just in time for dinner, they found
a great heap of firewood lying on the
ground where there had been nothing but
dirt when they started for the woods some
hours before.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot ran straight to the woodpile
and began sniffing and scratching and
whining.</p>

<p>If Johnnie Green hadn't been hungry
he would have paid more heed to Spot's
behavior. But the men had already gone
into the house. And Johnnie hurried
after them, leaving Spot to nose about the
woodpile as he pleased.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Spot growled. "Seems to
me Johnnie Green might stay here a while
and help me. I've been chasing woodchucks
and squirrels for him all the morning.
And I showed him a few birds,
too."</p>

<p>Spot never once left the woodpile while
Johnnie was eating his dinner. When
Johnnie and his father and the hired man
came out of the house later old Spot began
to yelp. He made frantic efforts to burrow
down beneath the pile of firewood,
stopping now and then to run up to his
young master and bark.</p>

<p>Now that he had had his dinner, Johnnie
Green was all ready for any sort of
fun.</p>

<p>"Spot smells some kind of game in the
woodpile!" Johnnie exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he does," said his father.
"But I don't see how he's going to get
hold of it unless we move the woodpile.
And I don't believe we'll quit work to help
the old dog catch a chipmunk&mdash;or maybe
a rat."</p>

<p>"Come on!" Spot begged Johnnie, as
plainly as he could bark. "Move some of
this wood for me! There's something
under it that I want to get my teeth on."</p>

<p>"All right! All right!" Johnnie told
him. And to his father Johnnie said,
"Do you care if I throw some of the stove
wood over on the other side of the pile?"</p>

<p>"If you're going to move any wood&mdash;"
Farmer Green replied with a wink at the
hired man&mdash;"if you're going to move any
wood you might as well move it into the
woodshed and pile it up neatly."</p>

<p>When he heard that suggestion Johnnie
Green looked very glum. For a minute
or two he thought he wouldn't bother to
help old Spot find what he was looking
for. But Spot teased and teased. And
Johnnie couldn't help being curious to
know what it was that Spot was after.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's a muskrat here," he
said to himself. "If there is, I'll have
his skin to pay me for my trouble."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br />A DEEP SECRET</h2>

<p>Old Spot wouldn't let Johnnie Green
alone. He kept jumping against him and
whining, begging him to move some of the
wood, because there was something very,
very interesting beneath it.</p>

<p>Still Johnnie hesitated. He hadn't intended
to do any work that afternoon.</p>

<p>"After all," he thought, "I'll have to
help carry in this wood sooner or later.
Really, I might as well take some of it
into the woodshed now."</p>

<p>To Spot's delight he bent over and began
gathering an armful of wood.</p>

<p>"Wow! Wow!" Spot howled. "Thank
goodness I'm going to get what's under
this pile, after all."</p>

<p>Johnnie Green carried armful after
armful of wood from the yard and piled
it in the shed back of the kitchen. All
the time old dog Spot was urging him
with yelps and barks and whines and
moans to move faster. And all the time
Johnnie Green was working as spryly as
he could.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be that Spot wanted
to get under the woodpile in the yard,
Johnnie hoped it wouldn't escape through
the crevices between the sticks.</p>

<p>"I don't want to get myself all tired
out for nothing," Johnnie said to himself.
"I was going fishing this afternoon."</p>

<p>While Johnnie hurried back and forth
between the woodpile and the shed Spot
clawed away at the edge of the pile. He
thrust his nose beneath loose sticks and
pushed them about. He uttered pitiful
sounds.</p>

<p>"I never saw that dog take on so,"
Farmer Green remarked.</p>

<p>"And I never saw Johnnie work so
hard," said the hired man. "When
there's wood to be carried in he's usually
a mile away."</p>

<p>Farmer Green laughed.</p>

<p>"He'll quit as soon as Spot gets what
he wants," he replied. "It's too bad this
sort of thing doesn't happen oftener.
Except for driving the cows home, this is
the first time I ever knew a boy and a dog
to do much besides play, when they're
together."</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot, the huge gobbler,
came hurrying around the corner of the
barn to see what was going on. He had
an idea that he ruled the farmyard.</p>

<p>"What's all this row about?" he gobbled
at old Spot. "Have you lost something?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Spot told him. "Johnnie
Green's helping me to find it. We're
moving part of the woodpile."</p>

<p>"What did you lose?" Turkey Proudfoot
demanded.</p>

<p>Old Spot pretended not to hear him.
He began barking again at Johnnie
Green.</p>

<p>Mr. Catbird, who loved to play jokes on
everybody, started mewing from his hiding
place under the lilac bushes. He had
noticed Spot's antics. And he hoped to
fool him into thinking there was a strange
cat around the place. For Spot was a
famous chaser of all cats&mdash;so long as they
kept running away from him and didn't
turn around and try to scratch him.</p>

<p>To Mr. Catbird's astonishment old Spot
paid no heed to his catcalls.</p>

<p>"This is queer," Mr. Catbird muttered.
"Whenever I've mewed before he has always
come a-running. There must be
something uncommonly interesting under
that woodpile."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<br />BURIED TREASURE</h2>

<p>Henrietta Hen, who was one of the busiest
busybodies on the farm, came along
and stood and watched old dog Spot while
he dug and scratched and howled about
the woodpile.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with
you?" she asked him. "I don't make
half that fuss when I've just laid an egg
and really have something to cackle
about."</p>

<p>"I've no time to talk with you now,"
Spot told Henrietta Hen. "Can't you see
that Johnnie Green and I are moving the
woodpile?"</p>

<p>"Why are you doing that?" Henrietta
inquired.</p>

<p>"There's something beneath it that I
want," he said hurriedly.</p>

<p>Henrietta Hen gave a sudden start.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it's a weasel!" she exclaimed.
And since he didn't reply, and
she had learned to be mortally afraid of
weasels, she ran off squawking, to hide
high up in the haymow in the barn.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green hadn't carried away
much more of the woodpile when old dog
Spot began to dig furiously in the dirt.
And in a few seconds' time he unearthed
a big bone.</p>

<p>It was a choice bone. He had buried
it several days before. And when he
came back from the woods and found a
woodpile on top of the place where he had
hidden it, it was no wonder that he made
such a howdy-do.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green looked much upset as he
stood stock still and saw Spot trot away
with the bone in his mouth.</p>

<p>"So <i>that</i> was what he was after all the
time!" he cried at last. "I hoped it was
a muskrat."</p>

<p>His father and the hired man laughed
and laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't see any joke," Johnnie grumbled.
"Here I've piled up wood enough
in the shed to last a month. And I might
have been fishing all the time."</p>

<p>"Well," said his father, "whose fault
is it?"</p>

<p>"Old Spot's, I should think!" Johnnie
replied.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can blame him,"
said Farmer Green. "Suppose you had
buried a piece of strawberry shortcake
here, expecting to eat it for your dinner.
And suppose there wasn't another piece
as good&mdash;or as big&mdash;to be had anywhere.
And suppose you had come back from a
tramp in the woods, hungry as&mdash;well, hungry
as you were this noon. Wouldn't you
want that piece of shortcake? If you
could get old Spot to move the wood off it,
wouldn't you be glad to have him do it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe!" Johnnie admitted. "Maybe!
But Spot wasn't after a piece of
strawberry shortcake. He was after an
old bone. And he fooled me."</p>

<p>"I should say that you fooled yourself,"
his father retorted. "Anyhow,
we're going to have strawberry shortcake
for supper to-night. I heard your
mother say so. And she made a special
cake for you."</p>

<p>That news made Johnnie Green look a
good deal less gloomy. In fact he almost
smiled.</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> going to give you that old fishing
rod of mine if you'd help carry in the
wood," Farmer <a name="Greene">Greene</a> went on. "And
you <i>could</i> take it now and go fishing, if
you thought you could be home in time for
supper."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" Johnnie Green suddenly
jumped up and down. "Hurrah!" he
cried. "And thank you very much!"</p>

<p>And when, an hour later, old Spot came
swimming across the creek and joined
Johnnie on the further bank, and shook
drops of water all over his young master,
Johnnie Green only patted him and called
him a "good old fellow."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br />SWIMMING</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot liked boys. Somehow they
always managed to have a lively time; and
usually they seemed glad to have him join
them in their sports.</p>

<p>He never could understand why Johnnie
Green and the neighbors' boys didn't
want him to play baseball with them.
Spot loved to chase a ball. And sometimes
when he was watching a game and
somebody hit a slow grounder he would
rush out and grab the ball and run
with it.</p>

<p>Then all the boys would run after him
and try to catch him. That always
pleased Spot mightily. And the longer
the chase lasted the happier he was. But
it was different with the boys. The
harder they had to run after Spot before
they got the ball away from him the more
out of patience they became.</p>

<p>Whenever Spot took part in a ball game
like that Johnnie Green usually put an
end to his fun, for the time being, by tying
him to something or other&mdash;perhaps a
fence or a tree. But even that was better&mdash;so
Spot thought&mdash;than being sent
home in disgrace.</p>

<p>Luckily there were other sports in
which Spot could romp with the boys as
much as he pleased, without anybody's
objecting. Nutting in the woods in the
fall; skating on the mill pond or coasting
down the long hill past Farmer Green's
house in the winter; berrying in the summer&mdash;and
swimming! Those were only a
few of the jolly times that Spot and the
boys enjoyed together.</p>

<p>Perhaps, of them all, both Spot and the
boys liked swimming the most. As for
Spot, he didn't care <i>where</i> he swam, so
long as the water was wet. Broad Brook,
Swift River, Black Creek, or the mill
pond&mdash;any one of those places suited him
as well as another. The boys, however,
preferred the mill pond. It was deep
enough, by the dam, to suit the best swimmers;
and it was shallow enough at the
upper end for those that were just
learning.</p>

<p>All the boys thought it great fun when
a wagon clattered over the bridge, which
crossed right above the dam. Then they
ducked into the water, with only their
heads out, and shouted more or less politely
at whoever was passing.</p>

<p>At such times Spot barked, because that
seemed to him the gentlemanly thing to
do. But he never could see any sense in
jumping into the water if he happened to
be out on the bank when a wagon came
along.</p>

<p>The boys threw sticks about the pond
for Spot to fetch back to them. They
raced with him. They upset him when he
was sunning himself on the big rock near
the dam, and they laughed to see the
splash he made when he struck the water.</p>

<p>No matter what tricks the boys played
on him, Spot never lost his temper. He
took everything good-naturedly. And
one day, when Johnnie Green and his
friends were swimming in the mill pond
he even took a bundle of clothes from
beneath a big hickory on the bank. Yes!
Spot caught up somebody's clothes in his
mouth and started along the road with
them.</p>

<p>He was surprised to hear a terrible outcry
from the water.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />WHAT RED DID</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot was trotting down the road
from the mill pond, carrying a bundle of
somebody's clothes in his mouth. When
he heard frantic shouts from the water,
where Johnnie Green and his friends were
swimming, he quickened his pace.</p>

<p>One of the swimmers was known as
"Red." And it was a favorite trick of
his to tie hard knots in other boys' garments
while the owners of them were in
the pond. Usually he wet the knots, because
wetting them made them harder to
untie.</p>

<p>On this day somebody had turned the
tables on Red. Somebody had crept up
behind the big old hickory tree on the
bank and had knotted Red's clothes tightly.
That was why old Spot found a bundle
under the tree, all tied up and ready
to carry off.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that the boys began
to yell when they saw Spot pick up those
clothes and calmly trot away with them.
It was no wonder that they swam to the
bank and scrambled up to the big hickory
to find out whose clothes were missing.</p>

<p>When they saw that Red was the unlucky
one, everybody else began to whoop
and laugh.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<a name="Squirrel" id="Squirrel"></a>
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="430" height="600" alt="Spot Started After Frisky Squirrel." title="Squirrel" />
<span class="caption">Spot Started After Frisky Squirrel.<br />
<a href="#illus3">(<i>Page 42</i>)</a>
</span>
</div>

<p>But not Red! He let out a frightened
scream and started to follow old dog Spot.</p>

<p>To the great delight of his companions,
the rattle of a wagon and the thud of a
horse's feet sounded from up the road.
And since some one must soon drive over
the bridge, which crossed right above the
dam, Red scurried back again and dived
into the pond, into which Johnnie Green
and the others had already plunged.</p>

<p>Red rose to the surface spluttering.
And finding that he could touch bottom
with his feet, he stood with his carroty
head out of water, watching for the
wagon.</p>

<p>It soon came into view, out of the woods,
and the horse that drew it thundered upon
the bridge. The horse was old Ebenezer;
and Farmer Green was driving him.</p>

<p>"Hi!" Red shouted. "Stop! Wait a
minute!"</p>

<p>Johnnie Green's father pulled Ebenezer
to a halt.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Spot took my clothes," Red explained.
"He's run down the road with them. Get
them for me&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>Hoots and catcalls from the other boys
followed Red's speech, which was a wonderfully
polite one&mdash;for him.</p>

<p>Farmer Green couldn't help laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm going to the village," he said.
"If I find any clothes along the road I'll
pick them up and put them in the wagon.
And if you're here when I come back I'll
give them to you."</p>

<p>"He'll be here!" Johnnie Green
shouted. "Red'll wait for you."</p>

<p>"If you hurry, maybe you can catch
Spot," Red called to Farmer Green as
he drove off. "I can't stay here all day."</p>

<p>"You'll have to," the boys jeered.</p>

<p>"Maybe you'll have to wait here till
dark," Johnnie Green suggested.</p>

<p>"I won't!" Red replied, as he swam
towards the bank. "Your dog took my
clothes," he cried as he ran up to the big
hickory. "And I'm going to take yours."</p>

<p>It was Johnnie's turn to yell then. He
was on the further side of the mill pond.
And long before he could cross it Red had
snatched up Johnnie's clothes from the
shade of the hickory and dodged into the
bushes with them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br />A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot was trotting down the road
with the bundle of clothes in his mouth&mdash;the
clothes which belonged to Johnnie
Green's friend Red, who was one of the
swimming party in the mill pond.</p>

<p>Somewhat to Spot's surprise the boys
had not come tearing down the road after
him.</p>

<p>"It's queer," he said to himself.
"I wonder why they don't follow me. This
would be fun if they'd only chase me."</p>

<p>Just then he happened to spy a squirrel
on a stone wall. Spot promptly made for
this gentleman. Keeping a firm hold on
his bundle, he plunged through a tangle
of blackberry bushes that grew beside the
road.</p>

<p>The thorny brambles caught at Spot's
bundle and held it fast.</p>

<p>"<i>G-r-r-r!</i>" he growled. "I don't want
to lose sight of that fat fellow. Unless
I'm mistaken, it was Frisky Squirrel.
And I've had an eye out for him for a
longtime."</p>

<p><a name="illus3">After a few frantic tugs he let go of the
bundle of clothes and dashed after the
squirrel.</a></p>

<p>It was Frisky Squirrel. He ran up a
tree while Spot was struggling in the
blackberry thicket. And he scampered
from one tree top to another while Spot
followed beneath him, barking furiously.</p>

<p>At last Frisky stopped and sat on a
limb, to chatter and scold at old dog Spot.</p>

<p>"What are you doing so far from
home?" he demanded after a while.</p>

<p>"I've been swimming in the mill pond
with the boys," said old dog Spot.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better go back there at
once, unless you want a punishing later,"
Frisky Squirrel told him. "I can hear
them whistling for you."</p>

<p>It wasn't far from the mill pond&mdash;that
place where they were talking, for Spot's
chase of Frisky Squirrel had led him back
up the hill again. Now Spot cocked his
ear in the direction of the pond and listened.
Sure enough! he could hear
Johnnie Green's whistle.</p>

<p>"I'll see you again," he told Frisky
Squirrel.</p>

<p>"Not if I see you first!" Frisky muttered
as old Spot started through the
woods for the mill pond.</p>

<p>"Come here!" Johnnie Green greeted
him sternly when, a few minutes later, he
appeared on the bank. "Where are those
clothes that you took?"</p>

<p>Spot wagged his tail. He acted very,
very friendly. Nobody would have supposed,
from his looks, that he had stolen
anyone's clothes.</p>

<p>"This is no joke," Johnnie Green declared.
"I haven't anything to wear.
Get those clothes and bring them back
here!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what's the matter with
Johnnie," Spot thought. "I didn't touch
his things. I don't see why he's so
angry."</p>

<p>"Good old Spot!" Johnnie coaxed.
"Find the clothes! There's a good fellow!"</p>

<p>He waded toward the bank and snapped
his fingers at Spot.</p>

<p>The old dog edged away. Johnnie
<i>talked</i> pleasantly enough. But he had a
queer look in his eye. Spot thought it
safer to keep out of his clutches.</p>

<p>Just then the miller came driving up
the hill on a load of corn. When he saw
the boys in the pond he stopped his
horses.</p>

<p>"Anybody here lost any clothes?" he
asked, holding a bundle up in his hand.
"I found these by the side of the road. I
noticed them hanging on a blackberry
bush."</p>

<p>"I'll take 'em!" Johnnie Green cried.
"They belong to Red. But you can leave
them with me."</p>

<p>The miller tossed the bundle to him.</p>

<p>The boy Red, wearing Johnnie's clothes,
was watching everything that went on,
from behind a tree. He waited until
Johnnie had untied the hard, wet knots in
the clothes. Then he stepped out from his
hiding place.</p>

<p>"Let's swap!" he said. And while
they were swapping, old dog Spot took a
swim in the mill pond. Somehow he felt
that all was well again.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br />DROPPING HINTS</h2>

<p>On the table in the kitchen of the farmhouse
was a leg of mutton. Farmer
Green had left it there and gone away.
And Mrs. Green had stepped out of the
kitchen&mdash;nobody knew for how long.</p>

<p>At least old dog Spot and Miss Kitty
Cat didn't know. They were left there
in the kitchen alone&mdash;alone with the leg
of mutton.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said Miss Kitty Cat to old
dog Spot. "Don't you think you'd better
go and see what's become of Farmer
Green?"</p>

<p>She was unusually pleasant, for her.
As a rule she had little to say to Spot, except
to scold at him.</p>

<p>"I'm comfortable here, thank you,"
Spot answered. "Farmer Green must be
out of sight by this time. So I won't
bother to chase after him."</p>

<p>"You could smell out his track, couldn't
you?" Miss Kitty Cat suggested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" said Spot. "Perhaps!
But as I said, I'm comfortable here. I'm
going to stay right here in the kitchen."
Out of the corner of his eye he looked at
Miss Kitty Cat. He could see that she
was somewhat displeased by something or
other. Her tail was beginning to swell
slightly. And that was a sure sign that
she was losing her temper. But when she
spoke again her voice was as sweet as
honey.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful day to go hunting!"
she remarked as she sprang into a chair
beside the window and looked out. "The
woods must be full of birds."</p>

<p>"No doubt!" said Spot dryly. "I went
hunting early this morning; and there was
plenty of game then."</p>

<p>"Ha!" Miss Kitty exclaimed suddenly.
"Do I hear the cows in the cornfield?"</p>

<p>Now, Spot loved to drive the cows out
of the corn. But for a wonder, he never
even moved an ear.</p>

<p>"I hope the sheep haven't scrambled
over the stone wall," Miss Kitty Cat
mewed. "If they have, Farmer Green
would want you to get them back into the
pasture for him."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Spot with a yawn. "I'm
sure he would. And if he needs me he
knows where he can find me."</p>

<p>Miss Kitty Cat's tail was growing bigger
every moment. And the fur on her
back was beginning to stand on end. Still
she managed to speak in her very softest
voice.</p>

<p>"Did you know&mdash;" she inquired&mdash;"did
you know that Johnnie Green had gone
swimming in the mill pond?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Spot. "Has he? I hope
he'll have a good time. I had a fine swim
yesterday in Black Creek. And I almost
caught a muskrat there."</p>

<p>As he spoke he rose and walked across
the big, square kitchen and stretched himself
out on the floor right in front of the
table where the leg of mutton lay.</p>

<p>At that Miss Kitty Cat gave a terrible
cry of rage.</p>

<p>"I know why you won't leave the
kitchen!" she yowled. "You think I'm
going to eat some of that mutton. And
that's why you've lain down alongside it."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br />MRS. GREEN'S MISTAKE</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot never moved from the place
where he was lying in front of the kitchen
table. Although Miss Kitty Cat had told
him angrily that he thought she was going
to enjoy a luncheon on the leg of mutton
that was on the kitchen table, he didn't
lose his temper.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" he said. "You are mistaken.
I don't think you're going to have
even a taste of this mutton&mdash;not while
I'm in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>Miss Kitty Cat was furious. She had
done her best to make Spot go away. She
had dropped a number of hints to get him
out of doors. But Spot hadn't taken a
single one of them.</p>

<p>"You're a meddlesome old dog," she
scolded. "I've a good mind to drag my
claws across your nose."</p>

<p>Spot grinned at her.</p>

<p>"If you do," he warned her, "I shall
yelp. Then Mrs. Green will hurry back
here to see what's going on. And you certainly
won't get any mutton while she's in
the kitchen. I happen to know that the
family's going to have that leg of mutton
for dinner to-morrow."</p>

<p>"There ought to be enough of it for
everybody," Miss Kitty Cat grumbled.
"If I ate a bit of it nobody would ever
miss it. And after I've finished my meal
there would be nothing to prevent your
helping yourself. I certainly shouldn't
stand in your way&mdash;nor lie in it, either."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot couldn't help sniffing.</p>

<p>"I never snatch any food when Mrs.
Green's back is turned," he told Miss
Kitty Cat severely. "She feeds me all
she thinks I ought to eat. And if I want
more, I hunt for it in the woods and
fields."</p>

<p>"Don't I hunt?" Miss Kitty Cat hissed.
"I keep the house free of rats and mice.
Mrs. Green could well spare me a bit of
that mutton in return for all I do for
her.... I'll thank you, sir, to move away
from that table!"</p>

<p>Old Spot began to look somewhat
anxious. He had once felt Miss Kitty's
sharp claws on his nose. And he didn't
care to be scratched by her again. But
there was the leg of mutton! He had to
guard that for Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>"I wish Mrs. Green would come back,"
he said to himself. "I don't want a row
with this Cat person."</p>

<p>Miss Kitty suddenly spat at him.</p>

<p>Spot knew that that was a danger sign.
And he gave a few short, sharp barks.</p>

<p>"There!" he muttered. "That ought
to fetch Mrs. Green. If she's in the house
she can't help hearing me."</p>

<p>Spot was right. In about a minute
Farmer Green's wife came hurrying into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot jumped up and wagged
his tail and gave a low-pitched bark as if
to say, "I've saved your leg of mutton
for you, Mrs. Green."</p>

<p>But she didn't understand him.</p>

<p>"You rascal!" Mrs. Green exclaimed.
"You've been teasing the cat again. I
can tell by the way she acts. Out you
go!" And she opened the door.</p>

<p>Spot went.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br />RIGHTING A WRONG</h2>

<p>Poor Spot! He felt so mournful that he
lifted up his muzzle and howled. Farmer
Green's wife had just ordered him out of
the kitchen. She thought he had been
teasing Miss Kitty Cat. And instead he
had kept Miss Kitty from tasting the leg
of mutton that lay on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>"It's a sad, sad world!" he howled. "I
thought Mrs. Green would praise me.
But she didn't. She scolded me!"</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" cried Henrietta Hen as
she rushed up to him in the farmyard.
"What's the matter with you? Are you
trying to bay the moon in the daytime?"</p>

<p>Turkey Proudfoot gobbled at Spot and
bade him be still. Turkey Proudfoot was
very pompous, for he had an idea that he
ruled the farmyard.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot felt so meek, after the
scolding that Mrs. Green gave him, that
he couldn't find a word to say to anybody
that spoke to him.</p>

<p>"I've expected this for some time," the
Rooster told Henrietta Hen. "Mrs.
Green has put old Spot out of the farmhouse.
And Farmer Green intends to put
him off the farm. Everyone agrees that
he's a nuisance. It's a wonder the folks
in the Green family have kept him all
these years."</p>

<p>Well, old dog Spot couldn't help hearing
what the Rooster said. And he hadn't
even heart enough to answer that impertinent
boaster.</p>

<p>"Maybe he knows what he's talking
about," Spot groaned. "I wish Johnnie
Green would come home. <i>He'd</i> stand up
for me, if nobody else will."</p>

<p>Then something happened all at once
that helped Spot's spirits amazingly.
The woodshed door flew open and Miss
Kitty Cat all but flew out of it. Farmer
Green's wife appeared in the doorway
with a broom in her hand. And with it
she helped Miss Kitty into the yard. She
helped her so much that Miss Kitty never
touched the broad stone doorstep at all.</p>

<p>"Scat!" cried Mrs. Green. "I don't
want any thieves in my kitchen."</p>

<p>It was quite plain that something had
displeased Mrs. Green&mdash;something in
which Miss Kitty Cat had had a part.
And old dog Spot thought he knew what
that something was.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he barked at Miss Kitty. "So
Mrs. Green found you out!" And he ran
at Miss Kitty and chased her into a tree.
She sat herself down upon a limb and
glared at him.</p>

<p>"Wow!" he yelped. "You must have
sampled that leg of mutton when you
thought Mrs. Green's back was turned.
And she must have caught you in the act."</p>

<p>Though that was exactly what had happened,
Miss Kitty Cat wouldn't say a
word. But she <i>looked</i> whole sentences
at him.</p>

<p>Soon Farmer Green's wife came to the
door again and called, "Come, Spot!
Come, Spot!"</p>

<p>He hurried up to her and caught the
piece of meat that she tossed to him.</p>

<p>It was mutton.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />HUNTING</h2>

<p>To please old dog Spot Johnnie Green
had only to ask him this question, "Want
to go hunting, Spot?"</p>

<p>When he heard that, Spot would leave
anything he happened to be doing, or give
up anything he had intended to do. Perhaps
he had expected to dig up and gnaw
a choice bone that he had buried somewhere.
It might be that he had been
planning to chase the cat, or tease Turkey
Proudfoot in order to hear him gobble.
There wasn't one of those pleasures that
Spot wouldn't gladly forgo for the sake of
going hunting with Johnnie Green.</p>

<p>When Johnnie Green's father first gave
him a shotgun Spot went almost frantic
with delight. And they lost no time in
starting for the woods. Johnnie Green
trudged up the lane with the gun on his
shoulder, while Spot ran on ahead of him,
returning now and then as if to urge
Johnnie to hurry.</p>

<p>They hadn't been long in the woods
when Spot suddenly stood still and
pointed ahead of him with his nose.</p>

<p>Try as he would, Johnnie couldn't see
what Spot was pointing at. So he took a
few steps forward until he came abreast
of the old dog. Then all at once there
was a rumbling <i>whir</i> that sounded to
Johnnie Green almost as loud as thunder.
A brownish streak flashed from the
ground just ahead of him.</p>

<p>He knew that it was a grouse rising.
And he fired.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green missed the bird. It had
given him such a start that he was still
shaking long afterward. He was disappointed,
but not less downcast than old
Spot.</p>

<p>"Never mind, old boy!" Johnnie said.
"We'll have better luck next time!"</p>

<p>But they didn't. Twice more that
same thing happened. And after the
third miss old <a name="Sport">Sport</a> turned tail and ran
away.</p>

<p>"I don't see what's the matter with that
boy," he muttered. "I've pointed three
birds for him. And he has let every one
of them get away.... There's no fun in
that kind of shooting."</p>

<p>After that Johnnie couldn't get Spot to
go into the woods with him. Whenever
Johnnie appeared in the yard with his
gun, Spot promptly vanished.</p>

<p>So Johnnie spent a good deal of time
shooting at old tin cans which he set on
a fence post or a stone wall. And it
wasn't long before he found he could hit
them at every shot.</p>

<p>At last he came home from the woods
one day with a grouse. When he showed
it to Spot the old dog actually began teasing
him to go hunting.</p>

<p>The next day they set out together for
the woods. And Johnnie knocked down
the very first grouse that Spot found for
him.</p>

<p>Spot brought the bird to Johnnie and
laid it proudly at his feet.</p>

<p>"Did Johnnie Green ever give you any
of the birds that you find for him?" Miss
Kitty Cat inquired when Spot was boasting
a bit about the sport he and Johnnie
had in the woods. "No!" she said, answering
her own question. "You're silly
to hunt for him. I prefer to do my hunting
alone. Then nobody can take the
game away from me."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot walked away from her, to
the barn.</p>

<p>"Miss Kitty Cat doesn't know what real
hunting is," he told the old horse Ebenezer.
"She creeps up on small birds after
dark, when they are asleep."</p>

<p>"And you creep up on big birds in the
daytime," said old Ebenezer, "so Johnnie
Green can shoot them."</p>

<p>Being a sporting dog, Spot couldn't see
anything queer in that remark.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" he said.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />MISSING HIS MASTER</h2>

<p>Johnnie Green went visiting one summer,
after haying was done. Much to
old dog Spot's disgust, Johnnie did not
take him on this journey. But it was not
Spot's fault that he was left at home.
Had he not been shut up in the harness
room in the barn when Johnnie drove
the old horse Ebenezer out of the yard
Spot would have followed beneath the
buggy.</p>

<p>It was hours before Farmer Green set
Spot free. When Farmer Green at last
flung open the door of the harness room
Spot rushed out and dashed into the road.
To his sorrow he couldn't smell a trace of
Ebenezer's track. So many other horses
had passed by the house since morning
that Spot couldn't even tell which way
Ebenezer had gone.</p>

<p>In desperation Spot ran up the road a
little way. Then he turned around and
ran down the hill as far as the gristmill.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the mill pond
Spot gave up the chase. He knew it was
hopeless.</p>

<p>And seeing several of Johnnie Green's
friends swimming in the pond, he joined
them.</p>

<p>The boys welcomed him with shouts.
And the water was just as cool as ever.
But somehow Spot didn't find swimming
as pleasant as he always had before. He
missed Johnnie Green. There wasn't
another boy there that gave Spot the same
thrill by whistling to him, or patting him,
or romping with him that Johnnie Green
gave him.</p>

<p>After a while Spot shook himself and
trotted back to Farmer Green's place.
He felt homesick. But when he reached
the house somehow he felt worse than
ever. It was terribly quiet. It was just
like a Sunday morning, when everybody
was at church. Farmer Green and the
hired man were working in the fields.
Mrs. Green was busy in the house&mdash;too
busy to stop and talk with old Spot.</p>

<p>"It's frightfully dull here," Spot
groaned. "I wish somebody would
shout." And just to break the silence he
lifted up his nose and tried to bark.</p>

<p>It was far from a cheerful noise that
he made, for he only succeeded in giving
a mournful howl. And that sad sound
made Spot gloomier than ever.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "there's nothing
else to do, so I'll go and dig up that bone
that I buried in the orchard last week."</p>

<p>He found the bone where he had hidden
it. Yet it did not look half as inviting
as it had when he covered it with dirt
a few days before. He stared at it dully.
Then he put it back in its hole and pawed
the dirt over it again.</p>

<p>He found no pleasure in anything. No
longer was there any fun in chasing
woodchucks. The cows might have stayed
in the cornfield all day long and Spot
wouldn't have bothered them. He didn't
even get any sport out of teasing Miss
Kitty Cat.</p>

<p>Strangest of all, he couldn't find any
comfort in lying down for a quiet nap.
The moment he tried to pass the time
away in that fashion he began to think
about Johnnie Green and what a nice boy
he was. And then he would get up and
walk around and around the house.
Hour after hour Spot spent in that
fashion.</p>

<p>It wasn't many days before he had worn
a path in the grass all the way around the
farmhouse. When Farmer Green noticed
it he didn't scold Spot. He patted his
head and said, "Cheer up, old boy!
Johnnie'll be back one of these days."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot wagged his tail feebly.
But it was hard to wait.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be so bad," he said to himself,
"if there was only somebody to play
with. If there was a puppy here on the
farm I'd have some one that would be
ready to romp whenever I felt like it.
And then Johnnie could go away visiting
every summer and I wouldn't miss him
half as much."</p>

<p>Spot forgot that a puppy wouldn't stay
a puppy forever.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br />A BASKETFUL OF FUN</h2>

<p>Johnnie Green came home from his visit
at last. The moment Spot heard the old
horse Ebenezer come jogging up the road
he tore out of the yard and ran, barking,
to meet the travellers. He frisked about
the buggy, he sprang up and touched
Ebenezer's nose with his own, he tried to
jump into the buggy beside Johnnie
Green.</p>

<p>Spot made such a racket that everybody
in the farmhouse knew that Johnnie
had returned. The family were just sitting
down for dinner. And they all hurried
out into the yard. For old dog Spot
was not the only one that had missed
Johnnie while he was away on his visit.</p>

<p>Johnnie leaped out of the buggy, to be
met by a smother of pawings and nosings
from old Spot.</p>

<p>"Now, Spot&mdash;you behave!" said Johnnie
Green. "I'm hungry and I want to
get my dinner."</p>

<p>Spot paid not the slightest heed to his
young master's objections. "You'll
never know how I've missed you," he
barked. "And if I want to romp with
you for a few minutes, I'm going to; and
nobody can stop me."</p>

<p>After a little Spot grew a bit calmer.
He let Johnnie Green turn to the buggy
and lift out a covered basket.</p>

<p>Spot promptly stuck his nose against it.
Then he drew back quickly.</p>

<p>"Wow!" he exclaimed. "This basket
smells <i>doggy!</i>"</p>

<p>Spot followed Johnnie into the house.
And in the woodshed Johnnie opened the
basket and brought out of it a soft, silky,
blinking&mdash;puppy!</p>

<p>"Wow!" said Spot again. "It was no
wonder that I noticed a doggy smell
about that basket." And then he said,
"G-r-r-r!"</p>

<p>Yes! Spot actually growled at the little
newcomer. For the moment he forgot
that he had been wishing, for days, that
there was a puppy about the place. To
tell the truth, he couldn't help feeling the
least bit jealous of Johnnie Green's new
pet.</p>

<p>In a day or two, however, old Spot liked
the puppy as much as anybody else did.
He proved to be a playful little chap.
And the older he grew the more fun-loving
he became.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;">
<a name="Puppy" id="Puppy"></a>
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="483" height="600" alt="Sometimes the Puppy Would Bite Spot&#39;s Tail." title="Puppy" />
<span class="caption">Sometimes the Puppy Would Bite Spot&#39;s Tail.<br />
<a href="#illus4">(<i>Page 73</i>)</a>
</span>
</div>

<p>There were no more dull days for old
dog Spot. When school opened in the fall
he no longer moped around the farmhouse,
waiting for Johnnie to come home.
The puppy kept him too busy to notice
Johnnie's absence.</p>

<p>At first Spot found it very pleasant to
roll on the ground with his small friend,
and pretend to bite him, and upset him
off his somewhat wobbly legs. But as
time passed Spot began to weary of never-ending
play. There were moments when Spot wanted to lie
still and doze. But as soon as he had settled himself
for a nap the puppy was sure to come bouncing up
and sprawl all over him. He would
seize one of Spot's long ears between his
teeth and give it a bit of a nip. <a name="illus4">Sometimes
he would even pull Spot's tail.</a></p>

<p>Of course nobody can sleep under such
interruptions. Spot learned that when
he wanted to rest he had to hide in some
place where the puppy couldn't follow
him. And as the puppy became bigger
Spot found it harder to slip away from
him. The youngster would trail Spot
into the barn and even as far as the hay-stack
in the meadow.</p>

<p>Once the old dog had <i>wished</i> for a
puppy. Now, however, he could scarcely
wait for this lively youngster to grow into
a dog.</p>

<p>A whole year passed before Spot had
any peace again. And when another
summer had come, and Johnnie Green
went visiting again, Spot muttered with a
deep groan:</p>

<p>"I hope Johnnie will have sense enough
not to bring another puppy with him when
he comes home."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />MRS. WOODCHUCK RUNS</h2>

<p>Mrs. Woodchuck was on her way home,
waddling across the pasture. She had
been making a call on Aunt Polly Woodchuck,
the herb doctor, who lived under
the hill. They had talked over all the
news in the neighborhood. And Mrs.
Woodchuck had her mind on some gossip
that Aunt Polly had told her. Otherwise
she might have noticed sooner that old dog
Spot had spied her.</p>

<p>If he hadn't spoken he would certainly
have caught her that time. For Mrs.
Woodchuck was fat and couldn't run as
fast as she used to. But when Spot's
keen nose caught a scent that told him
there was one of the Woodchuck family
not far away he just had to give one long-drawn
howl.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Woodchuck heard that
dreadful sound she scurried for home.
She dropped her knitting and the apple
that Aunt Polly had given her. And she
only managed to pop down the hole that
was her front door with Spot scarcely a
length behind her.</p>

<p>"Just missed her!" the old dog yelped.
"How unlucky!"</p>

<p>"Just escaped!" Mrs. Woodchuck
gasped. "How fortunate!"</p>

<p>She knew that she was safe. So she
took her own time in crawling through the
long hall that led to her one-room dwelling.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" she exclaimed as she entered
her underground home and saw that
it was empty. "Mr. Woodchuck and
Billy are away. I must hurry and warn
them that old dog Spot is prowling about
the pasture."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Spot lingered at Mrs. Woodchuck's
front door. He scratched in the
dirt that was thrown up before it. He
sniffed at the tracks that the Woodchuck
family had made all about.</p>

<p>"I know now where that fat Mrs. Woodchuck
lives," he growled. "I'll keep an
eye on this hole. Some day I may be able
to get between her and her home. And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish what he was saying,
but licked his lips as if he had just enjoyed
a hearty meal.</p>

<p>For a long time Spot waited there. He
could hardly have expected Mrs. Woodchuck
to come out and invite him to enter
her house. The most that she was likely
to do would be to creep not quite to the
upper end of her front hall and peer out to
see what she could through the small
round opening.</p>

<p>"That dame must have a family," Spot
thought. "I'd like to meet them&mdash;whether
there's one youngster or seven.
The more the merrier for me."</p>

<p>If Spot had happened to look around
just then he would have had his wish
granted. Or if the wind had been blowing
the other way he could have told, without
looking around, that Mrs. Woodchuck's
son Billy was gazing at him, with
popeyes, from behind a near-by hummock.
He had meandered homewards, pausing
here and there to nip off a clover head or
tear at a plantain leaf, little dreaming
that old dog Spot was right in his door-yard.</p>

<p>When he caught sight of the unwelcome
caller Billy sat up and took one good, long
look at him.</p>

<p>Then Mrs Woodchuck's son turned and
ran down the hillside as fast as his short
legs would carry him. He didn't stop until
he had reached the fence between the
pasture and the meadow. Dashing in
among the brakes that grew deep along
the fence he cowered under the cover that
they gave him.</p>

<p>All at once he felt quite ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p>"I almost forgot the rule!" he chattered.
"The rule says, 'When there's a
Dog about, warn everybody!'"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />THE DANGER SIGNAL</h2>

<p>Billy Woodchuck remembered, after he
had fled from old dog Spot, that he ought
to warn his family and his friends. So he
sat up, stuck his head out of the tangle of
brakes where he had hidden, and gave the
danger signal, a sharp whistle.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he said. "I fear Father
and Mother won't hear that. And if they
go home they'll run upon old dog Spot.
And then there's no knowing what might
happen."</p>

<p>He knew that his mother had gone to
see Aunt Polly Woodchuck, who lived under
the hill. And he knew that his father,
with a few cronies, was enjoying a feast
in Farmer Green's clover patch.</p>

<p>"I'll hurry over to Aunt Polly's first,"
he decided, "and tell Mother to beware
the Dog."</p>

<p>So Billy Woodchuck scampered off toward
the hill where Aunt Polly Woodchuck
made her home. When he knocked
at Aunt Polly's door and learned that
Mrs. Woodchuck had left some time before
Billy was much upset.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she went to the clover patch,"
Aunt Polly suggested. "You know your
father sometimes forgets to go home unless
somebody goes for him."</p>

<p>Well, Billy started off again. And he
hadn't gone far when he heard a sound
that made him sit up and listen. Like all
his family, he had very sharp ears. And
now, after cocking his head on one side
for a few moments, he knew that what he
heard was old dog Spot grumbling and
growling.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Billy Woodchuck
gasped. "He's left our house. And if I
don't look out he'll catch me."</p>

<p>At almost the same instant old Spot
paused and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried. "I smell a Woodchuck.
And if I'm not mistaken it's a
different Woodchuck from the one I
chased a little while ago."</p>

<p>Billy Woodchuck and Spot began to
run at the same time. Billy headed for
home; and Spot headed for him.</p>

<p>Again old dog Spot was just a bit too
late. Billy Woodchuck darted into the
hole in the hillside not a second too soon.
He could hear Spot panting close behind
him.</p>

<p>"Such luck!" Spot growled. "There's
another that's got away from me.
There's the second one that I've run into
that hole. I suppose they're chuckling
inside their house and making all manner
of fun of me."</p>

<p>The old dog was mistaken. Billy
Woodchuck was not chuckling. He
found nobody at home. It was plain that
his parents were still abroad.</p>

<p>"They may be coming from the clover
patch now," he groaned. <a name="creature">And</a> if they
are, they're sure to stumble upon that terrible
creature at the door. I must warn
them before it's too late."</p>

<p>While Spot was still snorting and snuffling
around the Woodchuck family's
front door, Billy Woodchuck crept out
of the back door and started for the clover
patch. Little did he know that his
mother had already stolen out the same
way, to warn him and his father.</p>

<p>When unwelcome callers come, a back
door is sometimes a convenient thing to
have about a house.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />A CROWDED HOUSE</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot never once guessed that
there was a back door to the Woodchuck
family's home in the pasture. He had
chased Mrs. Woodchuck into her house.
He had likewise hunted her son Billy into
the same front door through which his
mother had scrambled only a short time
before.</p>

<p>"There must be more of these fat folks
about the pasture," Spot thought. "I'll
range around a bit and see if I can't surprise
another."</p>

<p>So he began running about the pasture
in big circles. And he was lucky enough,
before long, to come upon Mr. Woodchuck
himself, who had dined so heartily
on clover heads that he had decided to go
to his chamber and take a nap.</p>

<p>Spot was unlucky enough to lose him.
Mr. Woodchuck had been feeling quite
sleepy. But when he suddenly found
himself pursued by a dog he was wide
awake in an instant and running like a
youngster.</p>

<p>He reached his home just in time.</p>

<p>"Well, that makes the third one that's
inside the house," Spot muttered, shortly
afterward, as he paused to get his breath.</p>

<p>Little did he know how mistaken he
was. There wasn't even one of the Woodchuck
family at home; for Mr. Woodchuck
had at once hurried out the back
way, because he wanted to find his wife
and his son and tell them to keep away
from old dog Spot.</p>

<p>Soon Spot took a few more turns
around the pasture. And this time he
ran across Mrs. Woodchuck again.</p>

<p>He had no sooner run her to earth once
more than he found Billy for the second
time.</p>

<p>"This is a twin brother of the fellow I
chased home once before," Spot panted,
little dreaming that Billy Woodchuck had
come back into the daylight.</p>

<p>"This twin is just as spry as the other
one was," Spot gasped as he reached for
Billy right at his door&mdash;and missed him.</p>

<p>After that the old dog chased Mr.
Woodchuck, then his wife, and next their
son Billy Woodchuck. And he didn't
succeed in catching any one of the three.
Each of them beat him in the race to the
Woodchuck family's front door.</p>

<p>Old Spot began to feel quite upset.</p>

<p>"I don't see what the matter with me to-day,"
he puzzled. "I hope I'm not getting
so old that I'm <i>weeble</i>." (By that
he meant <i>weak</i> and <i>feeble</i>.)</p>

<p>"This last one makes eight that I've followed
all the way to this door," Spot
growled. "There can't be many more
left in the pasture. I'm going to lie down
behind this hummock and wait till they
come out."</p>

<p>So he hid a little way off and watched
closely.</p>

<p>He had been there a long time when Mr.
Crow at last flew low over the pasture and
alighted in a tree near-by.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" he asked
Spot.</p>

<p>"Woodchucks!" said Spot. "This
burrow is full of them."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Mr. Crow inquired.</p>

<p>"I chased eight of them home," Spot
explained.</p>

<p>"That's odd," said Mr. Crow. "There
have been only three living here lately.
And they don't live here any more."</p>

<p>"They don't!" Spot cried.</p>

<p>"No!" Mr. Crow told him. "They
moved this afternoon."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Where did they go?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Mr. Crow croaked. "That's
telling." And he would say no more.</p>

<p>Then Spot went back to the farmyard.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Woodchuck family were
working hard, digging a new home for
themselves at the other end of the pasture.
They had all met at last on the edge of the
clover patch. And Mr. Woodchuck had
declared that they must move at once, because
it wasn't safe to live in their old
house any longer. He said that old dog
Spot would be sure to keep an eye on it
for some time.</p>

<p>They soon found a place that suited
them all very well.</p>

<p>"We'll live here," said Mr. Woodchuck
to his wife and their son Billy.
"You two can take turns digging while
I sit up and watch for old dog Spot.
After all the running I did to-day it
wouldn't be safe for me to do any digging."</p>

<p>That was Mr. Woodchuck's plan. And
they followed it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />OFF FOR THE CIRCUS</h2>

<p>Great circus posters had covered one side
of Farmer Green's barn for weeks. Ever
since some men came and pasted them on
the barn Johnnie Green had studied them
carefully. He had practiced bareback
riding on his pony, Twinkleheels. He
had tried a high dive into the mill pond
from the top of the dam. And much to
old dog Spot's disgust Johnnie had tried
to make him jump through a hoop covered
with paper.</p>

<p>Spot had refused flatly to do anything
of the kind. If he had known that his
young master had half a notion to teach
him to jump through a hoop of fire Spot
would have run away&mdash;at least until circus
time had come and gone.</p>

<p>"What puts all these queer ideas into
Johnnie's head?" the old dog asked his
friend Ebenezer, the horse, one day.</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" said Ebenezer.
"It's those circus pictures. Johnnie
won't think of anything else until the
twenty-third of August."</p>

<p>"What's going to happen then?" Spot
inquired.</p>

<p>"That's the day when the circus comes
to the village," the old horse explained.
"The whole family's going to see it."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to take them?"</p>

<p>"No!" Ebenezer replied. "Farmer
Green will hitch the bays to the carryall.
And to tell the truth, I'll be just as pleased
to stay behind. It will be a great day to
take naps here at home."</p>

<p>"It will be a lonesome day, with everybody
away," said Spot. "I believe I'll
go to the circus myself."</p>

<p>"Farmer Green may decide to leave you
here," the old horse suggested.</p>

<p>"Then I'll surprise him," said Spot.
"I'll hide behind a tree until Farmer
Green has driven out of the yard. And
then I'll follow the carryall."</p>

<p>The old dog began to tell everybody in
the farmyard that he was going to the circus
on the twenty-third of August. Of
course some of the farmyard folk were
jealous of him. The Rooster remarked
that he didn't believe Spot would hear any
<i>crowing</i> at the circus that would be worth
listening to. Turkey Proudfoot said that
when it came to <i>strutting</i> the circus
couldn't show Spot any that couldn't be
beaten right there on the farm. And
Henrietta Hen, who went to the county
fair the year before, declared that she
shouldn't care to go to the village except
to see a poultry show.</p>

<p>But old dog Spot didn't mind anything
they said. And when the twenty-third of
August came he lingered about the farmyard.
Early in the morning he saw
Farmer Green run the carryall into the
yard and harness the bays to it. Then
the rest of the family came out of the
house.</p>

<p>Spot, from his hiding place behind a
tree, was pleased to see that Johnnie
Green did not forget to bring a big lunch
basket with him.</p>

<p>At last everybody was ready to start.
And then, to Spot's dismay, Farmer
Green caught sight of his nose, sticking
out from behind a tree.</p>

<p>"That dog means to follow us," he
cried. "I'll have to shut him up in the
barn." And to old Spot he called, "Come
here, sir!"</p>

<p>Spot didn't dare disobey. With his
tail between his legs he crept up to the
carryall. And though he whined and
begged to be taken to the circus, Farmer
Green caught hold of his collar and led
him into the barn. Then Farmer Green
closed the door.</p>

<p>Poor Spot had to give one loud howl
when he heard the wheels of the carryall
crunching on the gravel driveway.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX<br />SPOT GOES TO TOWN</h2>

<p>The bays had to step lively that morning,
for Farmer Green's family didn't
want to be late for the circus parade in
the village.</p>

<p>There were many other teams on the
road, and almost nobody to be seen working
in the fields. It seemed to Johnnie
Green as if everybody had made up his
mind to go to the circus. The only thing
that troubled him was that his father
didn't drive fast enough to suit him.</p>

<p>Half way from the farm to the village
Farmer Green stopped the bays at a watering
trough. Johnnie jumped out of
the carryall to uncheck them, so they
could drink. And there, beneath the carriage,
was old dog Spot!</p>

<p>"Spot's followed us!" Johnnie Green
cried.</p>

<p>The old dog whisked out from between
the wheels and frolicked about Johnnie.
He didn't act at all guilty.</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" said Farmer Green.
"I certainly shut the barn door after I
shoved him inside."</p>

<p>Spot gave a few short, sharp barks, as
if to say, "Yes! But you forgot the window
that was open."</p>

<p>He had scrambled through the window
and overtaken the carryall before it
reached the gristmill.</p>

<p>Well, what could Farmer Green do?
They had come too far to send Spot back
home.</p>

<p>"We'll have to take him with us now,"
said Johnnie Green's father, "though
he'll be a nuisance because the village will
be crowded to-day."</p>

<p>As soon as the bays had had their drink
the party started on again. And old dog
Spot was content. He did not mind the
dust that the bays' heels kicked up as he
followed beneath the carriage. And the
faster they trotted, the more they pleased
him; for he was as anxious as Johnnie
Green to get to town and see the crowds
and the fun.</p>

<p>Once a surly dog ran out from a farmhouse
and tried to reach him. That made
Spot somewhat uneasy.</p>

<p>"I don't want to stop to fight this fellow,"
he thought. "If I do, I'll be left
behind."</p>

<p>Luckily Farmer Green cut at the
strange dog with his whip and bade him
be off.</p>

<p>Spot grinned as he sneaked away, yelping.</p>

<p>At last they entered the village. Main
Street was thronged with people. Carriages
and wagons of all sorts lined the
road on both sides&mdash;glistening buggies
with red ribbons tied in bows about the
whip stocks, old lumber wagons with
chairs set behind the driver's seat.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green had never seen such a
gathering&mdash;not even at the fair.</p>

<p>"The whole county's here!" he exclaimed.
"I hope we'll find a good place
to stop, where we can see the parade."</p>

<p>They did. Farmer Green backed the
bays into the last open space in the gutter.
And Johnnie Green was greatly relieved.</p>

<p>The crowd made such a roar, with its
talking and laughter, that old Spot cowered
down under the carryall and almost
wished he had stayed at home. The cries
of men selling peanuts and popcorn,
squawkers and toy balloons, mingled with
the shouts of small boys and the squeals
of their sisters.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" Spot murmured. "What
a racket! It hurts my ears."</p>

<p>A moment later he stuck his nose out
from beneath the carriage and burst into
a mournful howl.</p>

<p>"Keep still!" Farmer Green ordered.</p>

<p>Little did he know, then, what made
Spot cry like that. But in a minute or
two Johnnie Green heard the same thing
that Spot's sharp ears had caught first.
And Johnnie howled too.</p>

<p>"Hear the band!" he shouted. "Hurrah!
The parade's coming!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXI" id="XXI"></a>XXI<br />THE CIRCUS PARADE</h2>

<p>The crash and blare of the circus band
came nearer and nearer. Johnnie Green
craned his neck out of the carryall, as it
stood at the side of Main Street, and tried
to get a glimpse of the parade.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot did not howl again, but
stole out beside the bays and looked up
the street too.</p>

<p>Soon a man with a tall, shiny hat on
his head rode a proud, prancing horse
around a corner. And behind him six
more horses with gay plumes on their
bridles made a wide turn as they swung
into view. On top of the high red wagon
that they drew sat the band, all in red
suits and playing away like mad.</p>

<p>Spot couldn't help whining. Although
the bandsmen were playing the liveliest
air they knew, music always made Spot
sad. And he was glad when the band
wagon had passed on.</p>

<p>Other wagons, blazoned with red and
gold, followed.</p>

<p>Old dog Spot's hair began to rise along
his back and he sniffed, growling. He
had noticed a strange mixture of the
queerest odors. He didn't know, for a
moment, whether to run away or not.</p>

<p>"Oh, see the tiger!" Johnnie Green
shouted. "And the lions! And the monkeys!
And the bear!"</p>

<p>"<i>See</i> them!" Spot yelped. "I say,
<i>smell</i> them!"</p>

<p>He felt better when the animals in their
cages had gone creaking past. And he
forgot his uneasiness as he watched dozens
of horses, ridden by folk whose bespangled
clothes glittered in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Then came a funny man in a little, two-wheeled
cart, driving a donkey. This
was the clown. He bowed and smiled to
everybody, right and left, and even threw
kisses at some of the girls. His painted
face, his bag-like clothes, and his odd little
round, pointed hat made Johnnie
Green laugh. And to Johnnie's great delight,
when the clown saw Spot he whistled.</p>

<p>Old Spot was all for dashing out into
the street. But Farmer Green wouldn't
let him do that. Spot had to be content
with barking at the clown.</p>

<p>Then a man on a brisk little horse came
down the street. He had a big voice.
And he kept using it all the time, shouting
so everybody would be sure to hear, "Look
out for your bosses! The elephants are
coming!"</p>

<p>And they came. The elephants came.
When Spot saw their huge forms plodding
down Main Street he dived beneath
the carryall again and shivered until the
last one had passed along.</p>

<p>The bays stirred restlessly as the elephants
neared them. And the younger of
the pair snorted with fear.</p>

<p>Farmer Green talked to them in a soothing
voice and told them there wasn't any
danger. But nobody thought of talking
to old dog Spot. Every one forgot about
him. And he was just as badly frightened
as the bays, especially when a terrible
tooting and screeching burst forth.</p>

<p>Spot jumped almost out of his skin.</p>

<p>"Sakes alive!" he howled. "What awful
voices the elephants have!"</p>

<p>"The steam calliope!" Johnnie Green
cried. "And that's the end of the parade."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII<br />THE CIRCUS GROUNDS</h2>

<p>The Green family ate their luncheon in
the carryall on Main Street, after the circus
parade had passed. They didn't forget
to give old dog Spot something to eat
out of the big basket that they had
brought with them from home. Although
they hadn't expected him to go to the village
with them, there was more than
enough food for everybody. Even Johnnie
Green's appetite wasn't equal to all
the goodies that his mother had provided.</p>

<p>People were already starting for the
circus grounds on the outskirts of the village.
Johnnie Green noticed them uneasily.</p>

<p>"We don't want to be late for the
show," he reminded his father.</p>

<p>"We'll get there in time," Farmer
Green assured him.</p>

<p>And they did. Soon they followed the
crowd through the village streets until
they came in sight of the "big top," the
great tent with flags flying above it, and
smaller tents all around.</p>

<p>Farmer Green turned the bays into a
yard near-by, where he unharnessed and
fed them. Then he tied one end of a rope
to Spot's collar and fastened the other end
to a carriage wheel.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "Now we're
ready."</p>

<p>Old dog Spot didn't want to be left behind.
He tugged at the rope and whined.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" Johnnie Green's father
said to him. "You followed us to the
village. And now you'll have to behave
yourself. They wouldn't let you into the
show."</p>

<p>Then the Green family turned their
backs on him.</p>

<p>"They needn't think they can keep me
here," Spot growled. "I didn't run all
the way from the farm to the village to be
tied to a wagon wheel."</p>

<p>Johnnie Green and his father and
mother hadn't been gone a quarter of an
hour when Spot succeeded in slipping his
collar over his head. Then he dashed out
of the yard and ran to the circus grounds
as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Spot mingled with the crowds of people
that were pouring into the big tent. He
worked his way in and out among the
throng, all but tripping many of the pleasure
seekers.</p>

<p>Though he looked everywhere, he
couldn't find the Green family. They
had already passed through the entrance
and were enjoying the sights inside the
canvas.</p>

<p>At last Spot met a man&mdash;a circus man&mdash;who
was very friendly. It was pleasant
to get a kind word from somebody, after
so many people had told him to "get out,"
and had given him a shove.</p>

<p>This kindly person called Spot into a
low tent and patted him. He gave Spot
a bit of meat and even thought to offer
him a drink of water.</p>

<p>"This is a fine pointer," the man remarked
to a friend of his who was with
him. "He hasn't any collar; so he must
be anybody's dog. And he might as well
be mine."</p>

<p>Spot wagged his tail. He didn't quite
understand what his new acquaintance
was saying. But it seemed to be something
nice.</p>

<p>And then Spot decided, suddenly, that
he had stayed in that tent long enough.
For the pleasant man found a piece of
rope and tried to tie it about Spot's neck.</p>

<p>"I've been tied up once to-day; and once
is enough," Spot growled. Slipping out
of the man's grasp, Spot ran out of doors.</p>

<p>Both men followed him. For a few
minutes they chased him. One of them
tripped over a guy rope and sprawled on
the ground. And to escape the other
Spot dodged under a canvas wall where it
lifted slightly at the bottom.</p>

<p>He found himself in a huge tent where
hundreds of people sat all around on tiers
of seats. Men and horses were capering
about in the center of the place. And
somewhere a band was playing.</p>

<p>He was under the big top.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXIII" id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />SPOT SEES THE SHOW</h2>

<p>Old dog Spot was bewildered. When he
crawled under the canvas he had not
dreamed that he was entering the main
tent of the circus. He saw so many
strange sights that he didn't know
whether to bark or to crawl away and hide
somewhere. Yet among all those people
he felt lonely. He couldn't see anybody
he knew.</p>

<p>All at once the bandsmen began to play
louder than ever. They seemed to be trying
to burst their horns&mdash;or themselves.
And men in flowing robes, each one standing
in a sort of little two-wheeled cart and
driving four horses abreast, came tearing
past the place where Spot was standing.</p>

<p>It was a race! And if there was one
thing that Spot liked more than another
it was a race of any kind. He gave a few
delighted barks and ran after the galloping
horses.</p>

<p>Spot followed them twice around the
big tent. And just as he fell into a jog&mdash;for
the race was finished&mdash;he heard a
whistle that gave him a great thrill. He
stood still for an instant. Then he dashed
toward the nearest seats.</p>

<p>A moment later he was fawning upon
Johnnie Green, who sat in the lowest row
and seemed as glad to see Spot as Spot
was to see him.</p>

<p>Lying between Johnnie's feet, Spot
watched the rest of the show.</p>

<p>At last the circus was over. The Green
family, with Spot at their heels, went back
to the place where they had left the bays
and the carryall. And in a few minutes
more they were on their way back to
Pleasant Valley and home.</p>

<p>That morning everybody on the road
had seemed to be in a great hurry to get
to the village. And now, late in the afternoon,
everybody was in just as great a
hurry to get away from it. Farmer
Green kept the bays at a spanking trot,
only pausing to let them breathe now and
then on the hills.</p>

<p>Spot, however, was not in such haste
that he didn't stop and give a good trouncing
to the dog that had rushed out at him
earlier in the day. Spot sent the surly
fellow yelping into his master's yard.
Then he rushed down the road to overtake
the carryall.</p>

<p>But, to everybody's surprise, when they
reached home old dog Spot was missing.</p>

<p>"He'll come back," Farmer Green said.
"Probably he's stopped somewhere to
chase a rabbit or something. He'll be
along after a while."</p>

<p>But after the cows were milked old Spot
was still absent. And after the family
had eaten supper he had failed to appear.
Bedtime came. Still no Spot!</p>

<p>Johnnie Green felt very sad when he
went upstairs.</p>

<p>He felt even worse when morning came.
He had hoped that Spot would be in the
yard, begging for his breakfast.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green was able to eat only a
little of his own breakfast. And as soon
as he left the table he went to the barn and
harnessed his pony, Twinkleheels, to the
little buggy with the red wheels.</p>

<p>Then Johnnie started for the village.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXIV" id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br />HOME AGAIN</h2>

<p>Johnnie Green drove his pony, Twinkleheels,
back over the road that led to the
village. Now and then he stopped at a
farmhouse to inquire whether anybody
had seen old dog Spot, who had vanished
on the way home from the circus the evening
before.</p>

<p>Nobody had set eyes on him. And
Johnnie Green drove on and on, feeling
more and more miserable all the while.</p>

<p>At last, as he turned a sharp bend of
the road, he heard a bark. There was no
mistaking it. It was Spot's.</p>

<p>There was a joyful meeting then.
Johnnie sprang out of the buggy and Spot
sprang into his arms. And Johnnie
hugged the old fellow tightly, right there
in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>"What in the world has kept you here
ever since yesterday?" Johnnie asked.</p>

<p>Spot must have understood. Anyhow,
he dashed to one side of the road. And,
following him, Johnnie found there a robe
that belonged to his father. It had
dropped out of the carryall the evening
before, when the Green family were on
their way home from seeing the circus.
Nobody in the carriage had missed it.
But old Spot, running under the carriage,
had seen it fall. And he had stayed behind
to guard it all through the long
night.</p>

<p>Of course Spot couldn't tell Johnnie
Green all this. But Johnnie wasn't slow
in guessing what had happened.</p>

<p>He picked up the robe and put it under
the seat of the little buggy. Then he and
Spot both jumped in. And Johnnie
turned Twinkleheels' head toward home.</p>

<p>Back at the farm almost everybody said
that old dog Spot was a hero. Farmer
Green exclaimed that Spot was a faithful
old fellow. And Mrs. Green set out such
a meal for him as Spot had never seen
before in all his life.</p>

<p>Now, there were two or three of Spot's
neighbors in the farmyard that didn't like
the praise he was getting. Turkey Proudfoot,
the gobbler, remarked that if people
didn't know enough to come home to roost
at night he saw no reason for making a
fuss about it. Miss Kitty Cat declared
that so far as she was concerned she would
have been just as well pleased if Spot
hadn't come back to the farm at all. And
Henrietta Hen had more to say than anyone
else. She hurried up to old dog Spot
himself and insisted on talking with him.</p>

<p>"Huh!" she exclaimed. "You only
spent one day at the circus, while last fall
I stayed a whole week at the county fair."</p>

<p>"Did you hear a band at the fair?" Spot
asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Did you see any races?"</p>

<p>"There were races every day; but I
didn't care to watch them," Henrietta
Hen answered.</p>

<p>"Did you see any elephants at the
fair?" Spot demanded.</p>

<p>"Elephants?" said Henrietta Hen.
"What are elephants?"</p>

<p>Spot pointed&mdash;with his nose&mdash;to one of
the posters on the barn.</p>

<p>"There's a picture of some elephants,"
he told her. "And I must say it's a good
one."</p>

<p>"There were no elephants at the county
fair," Henrietta Hen admitted as she
gazed at the circus poster on the side of
the barn. "Why, every one of them has
two tails!" she cried. "I don't see how
they know whether they're going backward
or forward."</p>

<p>"Maybe they don't know," Spot retorted.
"Maybe that's part of the fun in
being an elephant. For I suppose there's
fun of some sort in being anybody, even
a-a-a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even a <i>what?</i>" Henrietta snapped.
"Were you going to say a <i>Hen?</i>"</p>

<p>"I was," Spot replied. "But I remembered
that it wouldn't be polite."</p>

<p>"I should say not!" Henrietta Hen
cackled. "I should say not!" And then,
being very angry, she hurried off to tell
the rooster what had happened.</p>

<p>"I'll have to be careful how I talk to
these farmyard folks," Spot muttered.
"They haven't had a chance to learn some
of the things that I know.</p>

<p>"For I've been to the village and seen
the world&mdash;and the circus, too," added old
dog Spot.</p>
